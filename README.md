# README

This is a new web application to mantain a list of repeaters all over the world and export it in the format required to
various different radios.

## Why does this exist?

Because I couldn't find anything that quite did what I want and I found myself massaging data in spreadsheets way too
much. This should be easier and should be easier for everybody.

I also believe that some information should be, so this project will be open source. I'll maintain it and host it, I'll
review the PRs, but anybody can make new PRs and request changes. Things anybody can do include:

 * Add new sources of repeaters that get imported periodically.
 * Add new export formats so that we can support every radio that exists.
 * Add new features.
